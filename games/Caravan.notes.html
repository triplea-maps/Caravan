Caravan <br>
						<br>

						<br>
						<br>In the deep, dark woods, a trade route is under threat from armed brigands. Can the town merchants get their goods through the forest paths safely?
						<br>
						<br>Rules:
						<br>-The <b>Caravans</b> produces 1 caravan cart a turn at the town center and must bring them to the Victory City.
						<br>-The <b>Escorts</b> places an initial bid (default 100 PU) on the town and does not produce any more units. Their job is to protect the Caravans from the Raiders.
						<br>-The <b>Raiders</b> recieves a fixed income of 10 PU a turn and builds units on the left and right edges of the map, where there are Raider bases. Each Raider base may build only 1 unit per turn. The job of the Raiders is to interdict the merchant convoy by attacking the Escorts and Caravans.
						<br>-The Escorts/Caravans win if <b>10 Caravans</b> get across to Victory City. The Raiders win if they can prevent the 10th Caravan from getting through, usually by killing all the Escorts before then.
						<br>The Raiders may not enter the town, and only the Caravans may enter Victory City.
						<br>Some hexes have either bushes or forests. Escorts cannot penetrate into the deep <b>forests</b>, but they can cut a path through the <b>bushes</b>. Note that bushes are actually immobile Raider units, so any Raiders hidden in the bushes gain 2 extra hitpoints when attacked.
						<br>-The Raiders may move freely though the bushes and forests.
						<br>
						<br><b>Units:</b>
						<br>Infantry -- 1/2/2 Supportable
						<br>Artillery -- 2/2/2/ Gives Support
						<br>Cavalry -- 1/1/3 Supportable
						<br>Elite Infantry 2/2/2 Supportable
						<br>Elite Cavalry 2/2/3 Supportable
						<br>Militia 1/1/1
						<br>Bushes 0/0/0 Two-hit
						<br>Caravan 6/0/2 (Not supposed to attack anyone, but mutually annihlates with the Markers on the Victory City. The 10th Caravan to the Victory City takes it.)
						<br>Marker 0/6/0 (see above)
